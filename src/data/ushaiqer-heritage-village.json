Ushaiger is located in the heart of Najd, on an area of oases 200 km northwest of the capital Riyadh; and it reflects a spirit of originality and authenticity of the Saudi society.The Bedouins settled there for the first time 1,500 years ago, and in no time; its urbanization prospered, and its architecture thrived, to become a popular stopping point for pilgrims' convoys heading to 'Makkah Al-Mukarramah', for its picturesque wells, orchards and palm trees.Ushaiger was named after Ù€Jabal Al-Ashqar that borders it from the north, and above itsmud houses. Despite being a small village with a limited number of residents;It has a number of schools, shops, and mosques lurking among its narrow heritage lanes, which will take you on a live heritage exploration journey to unveil part of the originality and heritage that abounds in Ushaiger.Ushaiger is surrounded by thick walls which throw their shades over the winding alleys and narrow wood-framed passages, to penetrate the hundreds of ancient mud houses decorated with palm groves, and to paint a painting of the ancient Najdi architectural design with its windows, triangular roofs, and wooden doors, on some of which the names of the families where they lived were carved.",
