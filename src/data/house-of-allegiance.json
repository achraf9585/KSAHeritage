The room is furnished with mats known locally as (Al-Madda) and has two wooden windows overlooking (Al-Hoi). The boards indicate that the late King Abdulaziz entered Al-Ahsa on the night of the twenty-eighth of Jumada I in the year 1331 AH / 1913 CE, and he proceeded with (600) men to the western side of the Kut district, also known as Nakhil (Al-Sifah), where some Al-Ahsa residents were waiting for him. According to the agreed-upon plan, he led a select group of his men toward a pre-prepared opening in the western wall of Kut, and the rest of his men followed in small groups; once his men's presence in the Kut district was complete, he divided them into three teams. The king then proceeded to the house of Sheikh Abdullatif bin Abdulrahman Al-Mulla, who had gathered the notables of Al-Ahsa in his house. And after discussions, everyone pledged allegiance to King Abdulaziz in accordance with the Book of Allah and the Sunnah (tradition) of His Prophet - peace be upon him - and vowed to listen and obey him. The herald shouted from the Kut wall early in the morning (Allah is the ruler of everything, and Abdullaziz bin Abdulrahman Al Saud is the ruler of our land). The following day, 1200 soldiers were deported to Al-Uqair prior to their transport to Bahrain. King Abdulaziz allowed them to carry their weapons, with the exception of ammunition and cannons.",
